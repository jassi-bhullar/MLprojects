    "\n",
    "Jennifer Shrader Lawrence was born on August 15, 1990 in Indian Hills, Kentucky, to Gary, a construction worker, and Karen (née Koch), a summer camp manager.[1][2] She has two older brothers, Ben and Blaine,[2] and her mother brought her up to be \"tough\" like them. Karen did not allow her daughter to play with other girls in preschool as she deemed her \"too rough\" with them.[3] Lawrence was educated at the Kammerer Middle School in Louisville.[3] She did not enjoy her childhood due to hyperactivity and social anxiety and considered herself a misfit among her peers.[2][4] Lawrence has said that her anxieties vanished when she performed on stage and that acting gave her a sense of accomplishment.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lawrence's school activities included cheerleading, softball, field hockey and basketball, which she played on a boys' team that was coached by her father.[3] While growing up, she was fond of horseback riding and frequently visited a local horse farm.[5] She has an injured tailbone as a result of being thrown from a horse.[6] When her father worked from home, she performed for him, often dressing up as a clown or ballerina.[7] She had her first acting assignment at age nine when she played the role of a prostitute in a church play that was based on the Book of Jonah. For the next few years, she continued to take parts in church plays and school musicals.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lawrence was fourteen and on a family vacation in New York City when she was spotted on the street by a talent scout who arranged for her to audition for talent agents.[8][9] Karen was not keen on allowing her daughter to pursue an acting career, but she briefly moved her family to New York to let her read for roles.[3] After Lawrence's first cold reading, the agents said that hers was the best they had heard from someone that young; Lawrence's mother convinced her that they were lying.[9] Lawrence said her early experiences were difficult because she felt lonely and friendless.[3] She signed on with the CESD Talent Agency, who convinced her parents to let her audition for roles in Los Angeles. While her mother encouraged her to go into modelling, Lawrence insisted on pursuing acting.[10] At that time, she considered acting to be a natural fit for her abilities, and she turned down several offers for modeling assignments.[8] Lawrence dropped out of school at age 14 without receiving a GED or a diploma. She has said that she was \"self-educated\" and that her career was her priority.[11] Between her acting jobs in the city, she made regular visits to Louisville, where she served as an assistant nurse at her mother's camp.[12]\n",

    "Lawrence began her acting career with a minor role in the television film Company Town (2006). She followed it with guest roles in several television shows, including Monk (2006) and Medium (2007).[13] These parts led to her being cast as a series regular on the TBS sitcom The Bill Engvall Show, in which she played Lauren, the rebellious teenage daughter of a family living in suburban Louisville, Colorado.[13] The series premiered in 2007 and ran for three seasons.[14] Tom Shales of The Washington Post considered her a scene stealer in her part, and David Hinckley of the New York Daily News wrote that she was successful in \"deliver[ing] the perpetual exasperation of teenage girls\".[15][16] Lawrence won a Young Artist Award for Outstanding Young Performer in a TV Series for the role in 2009.[17]\n",

    "Lawrence made her film debut in the 2008 drama film Garden Party, in which she played a troubled teenager named Tiff.[18] She then appeared in director Guillermo Arriaga's feature film debut The Burning Plain (2008), a drama narrated in a hyperlink format. She was cast as the teenage daughter of Kim Basinger's character who discovers her mother's extramarital affair—a role she shared with Charlize Theron; both actresses portrayed the role at different stages of the character's life. Mark Feeney for The Boston Globe thought of Lawrence's performance as \"a thankless task\", but Derek Elley from Variety praised her as the production's prime asset, writing that she \"plumbs fresher depths\" into the film.[19][20] Her performance earned her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Emerging Actress at the Venice Film Festival.[21] Also that year, she appeared in the music video for the song \"The Mess I Made\" by Parachute.[22] The following year, she starred in Lori Petty's drama The Poker House as the oldest of three sisters living with a drug-abusing mother.[23][24] Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter thought that Lawrence \"has a touching poise on camera that conveys the resilience of children\", and her role in The Poker House won an Outstanding Performance award from the Los Angeles Film Festival.[25][26]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lawrence's breakthrough role came in the small-scale drama Winter's Bone (2010), based on Daniel Woodrell's novel of the same name. In Debra Granik's independent feature, she portrayed Ree Dolly, a poverty-stricken teenager in the Ozark Mountains who cares for her mentally ill mother and younger siblings while searching for her missing father. Lawrence traveled to the Ozarks a week before filming began to live with the family on whom the story was based, and in preparation, she learned to fight, skin squirrels, and chop wood.[27][28] David Denby of The New Yorker said the film \"would be unimaginable with anyone less charismatic\",[29] and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that \"her performance is more than acting, it's a gathering storm. Lawrence's eyes are a roadmap to what's tearing Ree apart.\"[30] The production won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.[31] The actress was awarded the National Board of Review Award for Breakthrough Performance, and with her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, she became the second youngest person to be nominated in the category.[32]\n",

    "In 2011, Lawrence took on a supporting role in Like Crazy, a romantic drama about long-distance relationships, starring Anton Yelchin and Felicity Jones.[33] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times considered the film to be an \"intensely wrought and immensely satisfying love story\" and credited all three performers for \"making their [characters'] yearning palpable\".[34] She then appeared in Jodie Foster's black comedy The Beaver alongside Foster and Mel Gibson. Filmed in 2009, the production was delayed due to controversy concerning Gibson, and earned less than half of its $21 million budget.[35][36]\n",
    "\n",
    "After her dramatic role in Winter's Bone, Lawrence looked for something less serious, and found it with her first high-profile release—Matthew Vaughn's superhero film X-Men: First Class (2011)—a prequel to the X-Men film series.[37] She portrayed the shapeshifting mutant Mystique, a role played by Rebecca Romijn in the earlier films.[38] Vaughn cast Lawrence, as he thought that she would be able to portray the weakness and strength involved in the character's transformation.[39] For the part, Lawrence lost weight and practiced yoga.[40] For Mystique's blue form, she had to undergo eight hours of makeup, as Romijn had done on the other films.[41] She was intimidated in the role as she admired Romijn.[42] Writing for USA Today, Claudia Puig considered the film to be a \"classy re-boot\" of the film series, and believed that her \"high-spirited performance\" empowered the film.[43] With worldwide earnings of $350 million, X-Men: First Class became Lawrence's highest-grossing film at that point.[44]\n",

    "In 2012 she played Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, an adaptation of the first book in author Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy. Set in a post-apocalyptic future, the series tells the story of the teenage heroine Everdeen as she joins rebel forces against a totalitarian government after winning a brutal televised annual event. Despite being an admirer of the books, Lawrence was initially hesitant to accept the part, because of the grand scale of the film. She agreed to the project after her mother convinced her to take the part.[45] She practiced yoga, archery, rock and tree climbing, and hand-to-hand combat techniques for the role.[3][46][47] While training for the part, she injured herself running into a wall.[48] The film received generally positive reviews, and Lawrence's portrayal of Everdeen was particularly praised.[49] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called her an \"ideal screen actress\", adding that she embodies the Everdeen of the novel, and believed that she anchored the film \"with impressive gravity and presence\".[50] Roger Ebert agreed that she was \"strong and convincing in the central role\".[51] With worldwide revenues of over $690 million,[44] The Hunger Games became a top-grossing film featuring a female lead,[52] making Lawrence the highest-grossing action heroine of all time.[53] The success of the film established her as a star.[54]\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in 2012, Lawrence played a young widow with borderline personality disorder named Tiffany Maxwell in David O. Russell's romance movie Silver Linings Playbook. The film was an adaptation of Matthew Quick's novel of the same name. It follows her character finding companionship with Pat Solitano Jr. (played by Bradley Cooper), a man with bipolar disorder.[55][56] The actress was drawn to her character's complex personality: \"She didn't really fit any basic kind of character profile. Somebody who is very forceful and bullheaded is normally very insecure, but she isn't\".[57] While Russell initially considered Lawrence to be too young for the part, she convinced him to hire her via a Skype audition.[45] The actress found herself challenged by Russell's spontaneity as a director, and described working on the project as the \"best experience of my life\".[45] Richard Corliss of Time wrote: \"Just 21 when the movie was shot, Lawrence is that rare young actress who plays, who is, grown-up. Sullen and sultry, she lends a mature intelligence to any role.\"[58] Peter Travers believed that Lawrence \"is some kind of miracle. She's rude, dirty, funny, foulmouthed, sloppy, sexy, vibrant, and vulnerable, sometimes all in the same scene, even in the same breath.\"[59] She won the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, becoming—at age 22—the second youngest Best Actress winner.[60] Her final film of the year was alongside Max Thieriot and Elisabeth Shue in Mark Tonderai's critically panned thriller House at the End of the Street.[61]\n",
    "\n",
    "In January 2013, Lawrence hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live, with musical guest The Lumineers.[62] The Devil You Know, a small-scale production that Lawrence had filmed for in 2005, was her first release of 2013.[63] She then reprised the role of Everdeen in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, the second installment in the Hunger Games film series.[64] While performing the film's underwater stunts, she suffered from an ear infection that resulted in a brief loss of hearing.[48] With box office earnings of $865 million, the film remains her highest-grossing release.[44] Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice believed that Lawrence's portrayal of Everdeen made her an ideal role model, and wrote that \"there's no sanctimony or pretense of false modesty in the way Lawrence plays her\".[65] She took on a supporting role in Russell's ensemble crime drama American Hustle (2013) as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, the neurotic wife of con man Irving Rosenfeld (portrayed by Christian Bale). Inspired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Abscam sting operation, the film is set against the backdrop of political corruption in 1970s New Jersey.[66][67] Lawrence did little research for the part, and based her performance on knowledge of the era from the films and television shows she had seen.[54] Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent praised her as \"funny and acerbic\", especially for an improvised scene in which she aggressively kisses her husband's mistress (played by Amy Adams) on the lips.[66] Lawrence's performance won her the Golden Globe and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress, in addition to a third Academy Award nomination, her first in the supporting category.[68]\n",

    "Lawrence played Serena Pemberton in Susanne Bier's depression-era drama Serena (2014), based on the novel of the same name by Ron Rash. In the film, she and her husband George (portrayed by Bradley Cooper) become involved in criminal activities after realizing that they cannot bear children.[69] The project was filmed in 2012, and was released in 2014 to poor reviews.[70][71] Lawrence then reprised the role of Mystique in X-Men: Days of Future Past, which served as a sequel to both X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and X-Men: First Class (2011). The film received positive reviews and grossed $748.1 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film in the X-Men series to that point.[72][73] Justin Chang of Variety praised her look in the film but thought that she had little to do but \"glower, snarl and let the f/x artists do their thing\".[74] Lawrence's next two releases were in the final parts of The Hunger Games film series, Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) and Part 2 (2015).[75] For the musical score of the former film, she sang the song \"The Hanging Tree\",[76] which charted on multiple international singles charts.[77] In a review of the final film in the series, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times drew similarities between her rise to stardom and Everdeen's journey as a rebel leader, writing: \"Lawrence now inhabits the role as effortlessly as breathing, partly because, like all great stars, she seems to be playing a version of her 'real' self\".[78] Both films earned more than $650 million worldwide.[44]\n",

    "Lawrence worked with Russell for the third time in the biopic Joy (2015), in which she plays the eponymous character, a troubled single mother who becomes a successful businessperson after inventing the Miracle Mop.[79] During production in Boston, the press reported on a disagreement between Russell and Lawrence that resulted in a \"screaming match\". She said that her friendship with Russell made it easier for them to disagree, because people fight when they really love each other.[80] The film was not as well received as their previous collaborations, but her performance was praised.[81] Richard Roeper called it \"a wonderfully layered performance that carries the film through its rough spots and sometime dubious detours\" that was her best since Winter's Bone.[82] She won a third Golden Globe Award, and was nominated for another Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the youngest person to accrue four Oscar nominations.[83] Lawrence began 2016 by providing the narration for A Beautiful Planet, a documentary film that explores Earth from the International Space Station.[84] She played Mystique for the third time in X-Men: Apocalypse (2016). The film received mixed reviews, with a consensus that it was overfilled with action that detracted from the story's themes and cast's performances.[85] Helen O'Hara from Empire considered the film to be a letdown from the previous installments of the series, and criticized the actress for making her character too grim.[86] Despite this, she was rewarded Favorite Movie Actress at the 43rd People's Choice Awards.[87]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lawrence was paid $20 million for playing Aurora Lane in the science fiction film Passengers (2016), and she received top-billing over co-star Chris Pratt.[88][89] It features Pratt and her as two people who wake up 90 years too soon from an induced hibernation on a spaceship bound for a new planet. Lawrence says that she felt nervous performing her first sex scene and kissing a married man (Pratt) on screen; she drank alcohol to prepare herself for filming.[90] Critical reaction was mixed, but Lawrence defended the film by calling it a \"tainted, complicated love story\".[91][92] Darren Aronofsky's psychological horror film Mother! was Lawrence's sole release of 2017. She starred as a young wife who experiences trauma when her home is invaded by unexpected guests. Lawrence spent three months rehearsing the film in a warehouse in Brooklyn, despite her reluctance to rehearsals in her previous assignments.[93] The intense role proved difficult for her to film; she was put on supplemental oxygen when she hyperventilated one day, and she also dislocated a rib.[93] Mother! polarized viewers and prompted mass walkouts.[94] The film was better received by critics;[95] Walter Addiego of the San Francisco Chronicle labelled it \"assaultive\" and a \"deliberate test of audience endurance\", and credited Lawrence for \"never allow[ing] herself to be reduced simply to a howling victim\".[96]\n",
    "\n",
    "The following year, Lawrence starred as Dominika Egorova, a Russian spy who makes contact with a mysterious CIA agent (played by Joel Edgerton), in Francis Lawrence's espionage thriller Red Sparrow, based on Jason Matthews' novel of the same name.[97] She learned to speak in a Russian accent and undertook ballet training for four months.[98] Lawrence was challenged by the sexuality in her role, but has said that performing the nude scenes made her feel empowered.[99] IndieWire's Eric Kohn disliked the film's denouement, but praised the work of Lawrence and Charlotte Rampling, stating that \"the considerable talent on display is [the film's] constant saving grace.\"[100] A year later, Lawrence made her fourth and final appearance as Mystique, in Dark Phoenix, which received poor reviews and emerged as a box-office bomb.[101][102]\n",

    "In June 2019, Lawrence began production on an as-yet untitled film directed by Lila Neugebauer, which will be distributed by A24.[103] She will additionally produce a film adaptation of Hannah Kent's novel Burial Rites and star as Agnes Magnúsdóttir, the last woman to be executed for murder in Iceland.[104] She and Amy Schumer have written a screenplay for a film in which they will star.[105] However, Schumer later revealed the project was on the \"back burner\".[106]\n",

    "While filming X-Men: First Class in 2010, Lawrence began a romantic relationship with her co-star Nicholas Hoult. The couple broke up around the time they wrapped X-Men: Days of Future Past in 2014.[107][108] Also that year, she was one of the victims of the iCloud leaks of celebrity photos when dozens of self-photographed nude pictures of her were leaked online.[109] Lawrence emphasized that the images were never meant to go public; she called the leak a \"sex crime\" and a \"sexual violation\". She added that viewers of the images should be ashamed of their part in a sexual offense.[110] The actress later stated that her pictures were intended for Hoult, and that unlike other victims of the hack, she did not plan to sue Apple Inc.[107]\n",

    "In September 2016, she began dating director Darren Aronofsky, whom she met during the filming of mother!.[111][112] The couple split in November 2017.[113] In 2018, she began dating Cooke Maroney, an art gallery director, and the couple became engaged in February 2019.[114][115]\n",

She wrote about her own experiences in the industry, such as the lesser salary she received for her work in American Hustle compared to her male co-stars.[120] In a 2015 interview with Vogue, Lawrence criticized Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis for her opposition to same-sex marriage.[80] Lawrence was \"raised a Republican\", but has subsequently criticized the party's stance on women's rights.[80] She has strongly opposed Donald Trump's presidency, stating in 2015 that his election would \"be the end of the world\".[121]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lawrence became a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2011.[122] She has lent her support to several charitable organizations, such as the World Food Programme, Feeding America, and the Thirst Project.[123] Along with Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth, her co-stars of The Hunger Games (2012), Lawrence partnered with the United Nations to publicize poverty and hunger.[124] She organized an early screening of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) to benefit Saint Mary's Center, a disabilities organization in Louisville, and raised more than $40,000 for the cause.[125] She partnered with the charity broadcast network Chideo to raise funds for the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games by screening her film Serena (2014).[126] She also collaborated with Omaze to host a fundraising contest for the games as part of the premiere of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014).[127]\n",

Russell (who directed her in Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and Joy) has praised her effortless acting that makes her performances look easy.[139] During her career, Lawrence has played roles in both high-profile, mainstream productions and low-budget independent films, and has appeared in a range of film genres.[123] She did not study acting and has not been involved in professional theater.[9] She instead bases her acting approach on her observations of people around her.[140] The actress told The Globe and Mail in June 2010 that she does not \"invest any of my real emotions\" or take home any pains of her characters. Lawrence went on to say that \"I don't even take it to craft services\" and has never shared their experiences, relying instead on her imagination, noting \"I can't go around looking for roles that are exactly like my life.\" She stated that \"If it ever came down to the point where, to make a part better, I had to lose a little bit of my sanity, I wouldn't do it. I would just do comedies.\"[9]\n",

    "As her career has developed, Lawrence has become one of the best paid actresses; The Daily Telegraph reported in 2014 that she was earning $10 million a film.[141] In 2013, Time magazine named her one of the most 100 influential people in the world,[142] Elle labeled her the most powerful woman in the entertainment business,[143] and Forbes ranked her as the 50th most powerful actress.[144] In 2014, Forbes named her the second-highest-paid actress in the world with earnings of $34 million,[145] and cited her as the most powerful actress, ranking at number 12 in the magazine's Celebrity 100 list; she appeared in the list again in 2016.[146][147] In 2015, Lawrence was named \"Entertainer of the Year\" by Entertainment Weekly—a title she also won in 2012[148][149]—and was recognized as the highest-grossing action heroine in Guinness World Records for starring in the Hunger Games series.[150] In 2015 and 2016, Forbes reported that she had emerged as the world's highest-paid actress with annual earnings of $52 million and $46 million, respectively.[151] The magazine ranked her as the world's third and fourth highest-paid actress during the next two years, with respective earnings of $24 million and $18 million.[152][153] As of 2019, Lawrence's films have grossed over $6 billion worldwide.[154]\n",

Her starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with the war dramas In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), and First They Killed My Father (2017).\n",

    "Born Angelina Jolie Voight in Los Angeles, California, she is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[5] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[6] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[7] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[8][9] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[8] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[10] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[8][11]\n",

    "\n",
    "After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[12] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[13] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[14] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[15] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[16] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[12] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[14] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[17][18] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a \"punk outsider,\"[17] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[14] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[15] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[19] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[12][17] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, \"I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.\"[20]\n",
    "\n",
    "As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[21] later commenting, \"For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.\"[22] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[19] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used \"just about every drug possible,\" particularly heroin.[23] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[15] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[15] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, \"I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.\"[24]\n",
    "\n",
    "Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[25] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[26] They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[12] Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname \"Voight\" in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002.[27] Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had \"serious mental problems.\"[28] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight.[29] They did not speak for six and a half years,[30] but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[29][31] before going public with their reconciliation three years later.[29]\n",

    "\n",
    "Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was \"too dark.\"[15] She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's \"Stand by My Woman\" (1991), Antonello Venditti's \"Alta Marea\" (1991), The Lemonheads's \"It's About Time\" (1993), and Meat Loaf's \"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through\" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both \"drama queens.\"[14]\n",
    "\n",
    "Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[15] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, \"Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top.\"[32] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[33]\n",
    "\n",
    "After starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, \"Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello's character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her.\"[34] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, \"It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.\"[35]\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie \"finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is.\"[36] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as \"horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara\" who relies on \"gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.\"[37] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's \"Anybody Seen My Baby?\" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.[38]\n",
    "1998–2000: Breakthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film.[39] George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO's Gia (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, \"Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.\"[40] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.\n",
    "\n",
    "In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she would not be able to phone him: \"I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'\"[41] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had \"nothing else to give.\"[15] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting.[12] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.[15]\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the previously filmed gangster film Hell's Kitchen (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and Ryan Phillippe. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote, \"Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble.\"[42] She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe dismissed her as \"a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home.\"[43] Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's quadriplegic detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide,[44] but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded, \"Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast.\"[45]\n",

    "Jolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.[47] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For Variety, Emanuel Levy noted, \"Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation.\"[48]\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone in 60 Seconds, which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.[44] She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that \"all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.\"[49] Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.\n",
    "2001–2004: Mainstream recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday's John Anderson commented, \"Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth.\"[50] The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,[44] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.\n",

    "Jolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with \"soft-core nonsense.\"[51] The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon's Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance \"doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'\".[52] Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress;[20] in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.[53]\n",
    "\n",
    "Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.[44] She also starred in the music video for Korn's \"Did My Time\", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes.[54] Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie's ability to \"bring electricity and believability to roles,\" but wrote that \"the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her.\"[55]\n",
    "\n",
    "The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, \"Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.\"[56] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone's Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.[52] Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,[57] but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.[44]\n",

    "In 2005, Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted, \"While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry.\"[58] With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.[44][59]\n",
    "\n",
    "Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role,[60] the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface.[61] The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as \"well-measured and moving,\" played \"with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent.\"[62] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Jolie also played a shape-shifting seductress, Grendel's mother, in the epic Beowulf (2007), created through motion capture. The film was critically and commercially well received, taking in revenues of $196.4 million worldwide.[44]\n",
    "\n",
    "By 2008, Jolie was considered the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning $15–$20 million per film.[63][64] While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years, Jolie's perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $20 million plus a percentage.[65] She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted (2008), which proved an international success, earning $341.4 million worldwide.[44] The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was \"perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin,\" adding that \"she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.\"[66]\n",

Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, \"Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.\"[68] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda (2008), the first work in a major family franchise, later reprising her voice role in the sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "After her mother's death in 2007, Jolie began appearing in fewer films, later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother's acting ambitions.[69] Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt (2010), in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star, agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of $293.5 million, Salt became an international success.[44] The film received generally positive reviews, with Jolie's performance in particular earning praise; Empire critic William Thomas remarked, \"When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business.\"[70]\n",
    "\n",
    "Jolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The film was a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie's performance, stating that she \"does her darndest\" and \"plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality.\"[71] Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide,[44] cementing Jolie's appeal to international audiences.[72] She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[73][74]\n",

She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[76] To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay.[77] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what's onscreen.\"[78] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.[79]\n",

    "After a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of Disney's 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty. Critical reception was mixed, but Jolie's performance in the titular role was singled out for praise;[80] The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the \"heart and soul\" of the film, adding that she \"doesn't chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent—she infuses it, wielding a magnetic and effortless power.\"[81] In its opening weekend, Maleficent earned nearly $70 million at the North American box office and over $100 million in other markets, marking Jolie's appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films, genres usually dominated by male actors.[82] The film went on to gross $757.8 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year and Jolie's highest-grossing film ever.[44][83]\n",

She also served as producer under her Jolie Pas banner.[84] Unbroken is based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography of the same name, the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O'Connell.[85] After a positive early reception, Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender,[85][86] but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition,[87] though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[88][89] In a typical review, Variety's Justin Chang noted the film's \"impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint\", but deemed it \"an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms.\"[87][90] Financially, Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend,[91] eventually earning over $163 million worldwide.[92]\n",

    "Jolie's next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea (2015), in which she starred opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, marking their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Based on her screenplay, the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie, who drew inspiration from her own mother's life. Critics, however, dismissed it as a \"vanity project,\" as part of an overall poor reception.[93][94] Writing for The Washington Post, Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion, stating, \"By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous, as are its stars. But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness, sprinkled with stilted sentiments.\"[95] Despite starring two of Hollywood's leading actors, the film received only a limited release.[93]\n",

    "As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.[96] Labeling Jolie as a \"skilled and sensitive filmmaker\", Rafer Guzmán of Newsday commended her for \"convincingly depict[ing] the illogical hell of the Khmer Rouge era\".[97] It received nominations for the Golden Globe and BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.[98][99]\n",

    "—Jolie on her motives for joining UNHCR in 2001[105]\n",
    "\n",
    "Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[106] Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[105] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[105]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[107][108] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[109] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[105] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[110]\n",

    "Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.[111] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, \"Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.\"[107] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jolie aimed to visit what she termed \"forgotten emergencies,\" crises that media attention had shifted away from.[112] She became noted for travelling to war zones,[113] such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[114] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[115] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[116] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[113] To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world;[20][117] she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.[118][119][120]\n",
    "\n",
    "On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.[121] In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[122] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[123] Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.[111][124]\n",

    "In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born adopted son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[125] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[126]\n",
    "\n",
    "In November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[127] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[125] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[125]\n",
    "\n",
    "After filming Beyond Borders (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation.[128] In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary, a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari.[129] In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.[130][131][132] Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.[133]\n",

    "Jolie has also advocated for children's education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions.[138] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[138] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[139] Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.[140] Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit;[141] she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.[142]\n",

    "Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya,[143] which opened in 2005,[144] and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively.[145][146] In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.[147] In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.[127] In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[148]\n",

    "\n",
    "Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague,[153] who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).[154] PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation.[153] Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting,[155] where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration,[153] and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[156] In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject,[157] which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations.[158]\n",
    "\n",
    "Through her work on the PSVI, Jolie met foreign policy experts Chloe Dalton and Arminka Helic, who served as special advisers to Hague. Their collaboration resulted in the 2015 founding of Jolie Pitt Dalton Helic, a partnership dedicated to women's rights and international justice, among other causes.[159] In May 2016, Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics to contribute to a postgraduate degree program at the university's Centre on Women, Peace and Security,[160] which she had launched with Hague the previous year.[158]\n",

In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[161] and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association.[162] She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005,[163] and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007.[164] In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[165]\n",
    "\n",
    "In November 2013, Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[166][167] In June 2014, she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) for her services to the UK's foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones.[168][169] Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary damehood during a private ceremony the following October.[170]\n",

    "Relationships and marriages\n",
    "\n",
    "Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, \"I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way.\"[171] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[172]\n",
    "\n",
    "During filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[15] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.[173] Though the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called \"a solid man and a solid friend\".[19] Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.[174][175]\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to her marriage to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, \"I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.\"[176] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[177] In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, \"Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!\"[178]\n",

    "After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997).[175] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[179] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.[180] Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, \"It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but ... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet.\"[20]\n",
    "\n",
    "Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston in October 2005. She had fallen in love with Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair,[181] saying, \"To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.\"[178] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.[182]\n",

    "During their twelve-year relationship, \"Brangelina\"—a portmanteau coined by the entertainment media—were the subject of worldwide media coverage.[183] After the initial scandal subsided, they became one of Hollywood's most glamorous couples.[184] Their family grew to include six children, three of whom were adopted, before they announced their engagement in April 2012.[185] Jolie and Pitt married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Château Miraval in Correns, France.[186] She subsequently took the name \"Jolie Pitt\".[187] After two years of marriage, the couple separated in September 2016. In her divorce filing, Jolie requested physical custody of their children.[188] On November 11, 2018, a new custody agreement was established between Jolie and Pitt.[189] On April 12, 2019, the court restored Jolie and Pitt to single status.[190]\n",

She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was \"very fortunate\" to have been adopted by Jolie.[200] Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[198] She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia,[204] having first visited the country earlier that year.[205] After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children,[206] she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[201] Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.[207]\n",

    "On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[217] Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer.[218][219] Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation.[220] Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts.[218] Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive salpingo-oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.[219]\n",
    "\"I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options.\"\n",

    "—Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy[217]\n",

    "After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[217][219][221] Jolie further wrote, \"On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.\"[217]\n",
    "\n",
    "Jolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing.[222] Her decision was met with praise from various public figures,[223] while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women.[224] Dubbed \"The Angelina Effect\" by a Time cover story,[225] Jolie's influence led to a \"global and long-lasting\" increase in BRCA gene testing:[226] the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[226][227][228] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[229][230][231] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk.[226] In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs,[232] which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[233][234]\n",

That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand.\"[236] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, \"I'm so in love with my brother right now.\"[15] She dismissed the rumors, saying, \"It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus,\"[237] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.[15]\n",

In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[243] Jolie was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and a decade later became a spokesmodel for Guerlain. Her 2011 endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton, reportedly worth $10 million, was a record for a single advertising campaign.[244][245] Jolie was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[246][247] She was named the world's most powerful celebrity in Forbes's Celebrity 100 issue in 2009, and, though ranked lower overall, was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013.[248][249] Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively.[72][250][251]\n",

    "Jolie at the New York premiere of A Mighty Heart in June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible\n",
    "\n",
    "Jolie's public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal.[252] Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.[253] Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos, eyes, and in particular her full lips, which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas's chin or Bette Davis' eyes.[254] Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb quod me nutrit me destruit (\"what nourishes me destroys me\"), the Tennessee Williams quote \"A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages\", four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection,[255][256] a twelve-inch tiger, and geographical coordinates of where she first met her adopted children.[257] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including \"Billy Bob\", the name of her second husband.[255]\n",
    "\n",
    "Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,[258][259] with Empire stating that her \"pneumatic figure\", \"feline eyes\", and \"bee-stung lips\" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.[260] Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's \"dark and intense sexuality\" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,[52] while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having \"the most beautiful face on the planet\" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.[261]\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that \"there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does\".[262] Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered \"the gold standard of beauty\",[263] with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.[264][265] After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American beauty ideal, compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991, writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having \"branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different\".[266][267] In 2013, Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal, and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty.[225] \"\"\""

    "Pitt was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to William Alvin Pitt, the proprietor of a trucking company, and Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a school counsellor.[2][3] The family soon moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, Douglas Mitchell (born 1966) and Julie Neal (born 1969).[4] Born into a conservative household,[5] he was raised as Southern Baptist but has since stated that he does not \"have a great relationship with religion\" and that he \"oscillate[s] between agnosticism and atheism.\"[6] Pitt has described Springfield as \"Mark Twain country, Jesse James country,\" having grown up with \"a lot of hills, a lot of lakes.\"[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitt attended Kickapoo High School, where he was a member of the golf, swimming and tennis teams.[8] He participated in the school's Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals.[9] Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising.[10] As graduation approached, Pitt did not feel ready to settle down. He loved films—\"a portal into different worlds for me\"—and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made.[11][12] Two weeks short of completing the coursework for a degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs.[11] He has named his early acting heroes as Gary Oldman, Sean Penn and Mickey Rourke.[13]\n",

    "While struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London.[9][14] Pitt's acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films No Way Out (1987), No Man's Land (1987) and Less Than Zero (1987).[9][15] In May 1987, his television debut came with a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera Another World.[16] In November of the same year, Pitt had a guest appearance on the ABC sitcom Growing Pains.[17] He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series Dallas between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Charlie Wade (played by Shalane McCall).[18] Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the Fox police drama 21 Jump Street.[19] In the same year, the Yugoslavian–U.S. co-production The Dark Side of the Sun (1988) gave Pitt his first leading film role, as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997.[9] Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters.[17] He made guest appearances on television series Head of the Class, Freddy's Nightmares, Thirtysomething, and (for a second time) Growing Pains.[20]\n",

    "Pitt was cast as Billy Canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the 1990 NBC television movie Too Young to Die?, the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder. Ken Tucker, television reviewer for Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he's really scary.\"[21] The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama Glory Days and took a supporting role in the HBO television film The Image.[22] His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by Rick Schroder.[23] After years of supporting roles in film and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in Ridley Scott's 1991 road film Thelma & Louise.[22] He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (Geena Davis). His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol.[17][24] After Thelma & Louise, Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny Suede, a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star,[25] and the 1992 live-action/animated fantasy film Cool World,[17] although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.[26][27]\n",

    "Pitt took the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It, directed by Robert Redford.[28] His portrayal of the character was described by People's Janet Mock as a career-making performance,[29] proving that Pitt could be more than a \"cowboy-hatted hunk.\"[30] He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film[4] and thought it one of his \"weakest performances ... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for.\"[4] Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying \"when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better.\"[29][30] In 1993, Pitt reunited with Juliette Lewis for the road film Kalifornia. He played Early Grayce, a serial killer and the boyfriend of Lewis's character in a performance described by Peter Travers of Rolling Stone as \"outstanding, all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace.\"[31] Pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit True Romance as a stoner named Floyd, providing much needed comic relief to the action film.[32] He capped the year by winning a ShoWest Award for Male Star of Tomorrow.[33]\n",

    "1994 marked a significant turning point in Pitt's career. Starring as the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the horror film Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, based on Anne Rice's 1976 novel of the same name,[34] he was part of an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, and Antonio Banderas.[34] Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony,[35] his performance was poorly received. According to the Dallas Observer, \"Brad Pitt [...] is a large part of the problem [in the film]. When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side [...] he's a joy to watch. But there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis.\"[36] Following the release of Interview with the Vampire, Pitt starred in Legends of the Fall (1994),[37] based on a novel by the same name by Jim Harrison, set in the American West during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Portraying Tristan Ludlow, son of Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) a Cornish immigrant,[38] Pitt received his first Golden Globe Award nomination, in the Best Actor category.[39] Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas co-starred as Pitt's brothers. Although the film's reception was mixed,[40] many film critics praised Pitt's performance. Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, \"Pitt's diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it's a shame the film's superficiality gets in his way.\"[41] The Deseret News predicted that Legends of the Fall would solidify Pitt's reputation as a lead actor.[42]\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1995, Pitt starred alongside Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow in the crime thriller Seven, playing a detective on the trail of a serial killer.[43] Pitt called it a great movie and declared the part would expand his acting horizons.[44] He expressed his intent to move on from \"this 'pretty boy' thing [...] and play someone with flaws.\"[45] His performance was critically well received, with Variety saying that it was screen acting at its best, further remarking on Pitt's ability to turn in a \"determined, energetic, creditable job\" as the detective.[46] Seven earned $327 million at the international box office.[26] Following the success of Seven, Pitt took a supporting role as Jeffrey Goines in Terry Gilliam's 1995 science-fiction film 12 Monkeys. The movie received predominantly positive reviews, with Pitt praised in particular. Janet Maslin of the New York Times called Twelve Monkeys \"fierce and disturbing\" and remarked on Pitt's \"startlingly frenzied performance\", concluding that he \"electrifies Jeffrey with a weird magnetism that becomes important later in the film.\"[47] He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film[39] and received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[48]\n",
    "\n",
    "The following year he had a role in the legal drama Sleepers (1996), based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's novel of the same name.[49] The film received mixed reviews.[50] In the 1997 film The Devil's Own Pitt starred, opposite Harrison Ford, as the Irish Republican Army terrorist Rory Devany,[51] a role for which he was required to learn an Irish accent.[52] Critical opinion was divided on his accent; \"Pitt finds the right tone of moral ambiguity, but at times his Irish brogue is too convincing – it's hard to understand what he's saying\", wrote the San Francisco Chronicle.[53] The Charleston Gazette opined that it had favored Pitt's accent over the movie.[54] The Devil's Own grossed $140 million worldwide,[26] but was a critical failure. Later that year he led as Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer in the Jean-Jacques Annaud film Seven Years in Tibet.[55] Pitt trained for months for the role, which demanded significant mountain climbing and trekking practice, including rock climbing in California and the European Alps with his co-star David Thewlis.[56] The film received mostly negative reviews, and was generally considered a disappointment.[57] Pitt had the lead role in 1998's fantasy romance film Meet Joe Black. He portrayed a personification of death inhabiting the body of a young man to learn what it is like to be human.[58] The film received mixed reviews, and many were critical of Pitt's performance. According to Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, Pitt was unable to \"make an audience believe that he knows all the mysteries of death and eternity.\"[59] Roger Ebert stated \"Pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation.\"[60]\n",

    "In 1999, Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in Fight Club,[61][62] a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher.[63] Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling.[64] To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended.[65] While promoting Fight Club, Pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out on someone else but to \"have an experience, take a punch more and see how you come out on the other end.\"[66] Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival.[67] Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole,[68][69] Pitt's performance was widely praised. Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film,[70] while Variety remarked upon Pitt's ability to be \"cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than [...] his breakthrough role in Thelma and Louise\".[71] In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, Fight Club became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.[72]\n",

    "Pitt was cast as an Irish Gypsy boxer with a barely intelligible accent in Guy Ritchie's 2000 gangster film Snatch.[73] Several reviewers were critical of Snatch; however, most praised Pitt.[74] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said Pitt was \"ideally cast as an Irishman whose accent is so thick even Brits can't understand him\", going on to say that, before Snatch, Pitt had been \"shackled by roles that called for brooding introspection, but recently he has found his calling in black comic outrageousness and flashy extroversion;\"[75] while Amy Taubin of The Village Voice claimed that \"Pitt gets maximum comic mileage out of a one-joke role\".[76] The following year Pitt starred opposite Julia Roberts in the romantic comedy The Mexican,[77] a film that garnered a range of reviews[78] but enjoyed box office success.[26] Pitt's next role, in 2001's $143 million-grossing Cold War thriller Spy Game,[26] was as Tom Bishop, an operative of the CIA's Special Activities Division, mentored by Robert Redford's character.[79] Mark Holcomb of Salon.com enjoyed the film, although he noted that neither Pitt nor Redford provided \"much of an emotional connection for the audience\".[80]\n",

    "On November 22, 2001, Pitt made a guest appearance in the eighth season of the television series Friends, playing a man with a grudge against Rachel Green, played by Jennifer Aniston, to whom Pitt was married at the time.[81] For this performance he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.[82] In December 2001, Pitt played Rusty Ryan in the heist film Ocean's Eleven, a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack original. He joined an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy García, and Julia Roberts.[83] Well received by critics, Ocean's Eleven was highly successful at the box office, earning $450 million worldwide.[26] Pitt appeared in two episodes of MTV's reality series Jackass in February 2002, first running through the streets of Los Angeles with several cast members in gorilla suits,[84] and participating in his own staged abduction in another episode.[85] In the same year, Pitt had a cameo role in George Clooney's directorial debut Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.[86] He took on his first voice-acting roles in 2003, speaking as the titular character of the DreamWorks animated film Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas[87] and playing Boomhauer's brother, Patch, in an episode of the animated television series King of the Hill.[88]\n",

He spent six months sword training before the filming of Troy, based on the Iliad.[89] An on-set injury to his Achilles tendon delayed production on the picture for several weeks.[90] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post stated that Pitt excelled at such a demanding role.[91] Troy was the first film produced by Plan B Entertainment, a film production company he had founded two years earlier with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Grey, CEO of Paramount Pictures.[92] Ocean's Twelve earned $362 million worldwide,[26] and Pitt and Clooney's dynamic was described by CNN's Paul Clinton as \"the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford.\"[93] In 2005, Pitt starred in the Doug Liman-directed action comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which a bored married couple discover that each is an assassin sent to kill the other. The feature received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who played his character's wife Jane Smith. The Star Tribune noted that \"while the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry\".[94] Mr. & Mrs. Smith earned $478 million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.[95]\n",

Pitt was credited on-screen as a producer; however, only Graham King was ruled eligible for the Oscar win.[101]\n",

    "Reprising his role as Rusty Ryan in a third picture, Pitt starred in 2007's Ocean's Thirteen.[102] While less lucrative than the first two films, this sequel earned $311 million at the international box office.[26] Pitt's next film role was as American outlaw Jesse James in the 2007 Western drama The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, adapted from Ron Hansen's 1983 novel of the same name.[103] Directed by Andrew Dominik and produced by Pitt's company Plan B Entertainment, the film premiered at the 2007 Venice Film Festival,[104] with Pitt playing a \"scary and charismatic\" role, according to Lewis Beale of Film Journal International,[105] and earning Pitt the Volpi Cup award for Best Actor at the 64th Venice International Film Festival.[106] He eventually collected the award one year later at the 2008 festival.[107] It is his favourite film.[108]\n",

The film received a positive reception from critics, with The Guardian calling it \"a tightly wound, slickly plotted spy comedy\",[109] noting that Pitt's performance was one of the funniest.[109] He was later cast as Benjamin Button, the lead in David Fincher's 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, a loosely adapted version of a 1921 short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The story follows a man who is born an octogenarian and ages in reverse,[110] with Pitt's \"sensitive\" performance making Benjamin Button a \"timeless masterpiece\", according to Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun.[111] The performance earned Pitt his first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination,[112] as well as a fourth Golden Globe and second Academy Award nomination,[39][113] all in the category for Best Actor.

    "Cruise was born in Syracuse, New York, the son of Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer) (1936–2017), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III (1934–1984),[5] an electrical engineer, both originally from Louisville, Kentucky.[6][7] He has three sisters: Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. They are of English, German, and Irish ancestry.[8][9] One of Cruise's ancestors, Patrick Russell Cruise, was born in north County Dublin in 1799; he married Teresa Johnson in County Meath, in 1825. They left Ireland for the United States that same year and settled in New York.[8] They had a daughter, Mary Paulina Russell Cruise, whose son Thomas Cruise Mapother was Cruise's great-grandfather.[10][11][12][13] A cousin, William Mapother, is also an actor; he and Cruise have appeared in five films together.[14]\n",
    "\n",
    "Cruise grew up in near poverty and had a Catholic upbringing. Cruise described his father as \"a merchant of chaos\",[15] a \"bully\", and a \"coward\" who inflicted beatings upon him. Regarding his father, Cruise once said, \"He was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he'd lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, 'There's something wrong with this guy. Don't trust him. Be careful around him.'\"[15]\n",

    "Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada. His family moved to Beacon Hill, Ottawa in late 1971 so that Cruise's father could take a position as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces.[16] There, Cruise attended the newly opened Robert Hopkins Public School for much of grade four and grade five.[16][17] In grade four, Cruise first became involved in drama, under the tutelage of George Steinburg. Cruise and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival.[16] Drama organizer Val Wright, who was in the audience that night, reflected, \"The movement and improvisation were excellent. It was a classic ensemble piece.\"[16]\n",

    "In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. However, in the spring of that year, Cruise's mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States;[16] in 1978, she married Jack South.[18] Cruise's father died of cancer in 1984.[19] Cruise briefly attended a Franciscan seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio on a church scholarship and aspired to become a Catholic priest before he became interested in acting.[20]:24–26 In total, Cruise attended 15 schools in 14 years.[21] In his senior year of high school, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game.[20]:47 Also in his senior year, Cruise starred in his high school's production of Guys and Dolls.[22] He graduated from Glen Ridge High School in Glen Ridge, New Jersey in 1980.[23]\n",

In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of The Outsiders. That same year he appeared in All the Right Moves and Risky Business, which has been described as \"A Generation X classic, and a career-maker for Tom Cruise\",[25] and which, along with 1986's Top Gun, cemented his status as a superstar.[26] Cruise also played the male lead in the Ridley Scott film Legend, released in 1985.[27]\n",

    "Cruise's next films were Days of Thunder (1990) and Far and Away (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife Nicole Kidman as his love interest. In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire, a gothic drama/horror film that was based on Anne Rice's best-selling novel. The film was well received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. Upon seeing the film however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in Daily Variety praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.[28]\n",

    "In 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy Ethan Hunt in the reboot of Mission: Impossible, which he produced. It was a box office success, although it received criticism regarding the Jim Phelps character being a villain despite being a protagonist of the original television series.[29]\n",

Like its predecessor, it was the highest-grossing film of the year, and had a mixed critical reception. Cruise received an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance for this film.\n",

    "His next five films were major critical and commercial successes.[30][31] The following year Cruise starred in the romantic thriller Vanilla Sky (2001) with Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz.

This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as \"Les Grossman\" in the 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder with Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. This performance earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination.

The film was released in June 2012.[40]\n",

The film was released on December 21, 2012.[41] It met with positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $216,568,266 worldwide.[42][43] In 2013, he starred in the science fiction film Oblivion based on director Joseph Kosinski's graphic novel of the same name.

    "Cruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993,[49] and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise's films, the first being Mission: Impossible in 1996 which was also Cruise's first project as a producer.\n",
    "Cruise in 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as \"one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood.\" Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise's tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise's exceptional commercial prowess.[50]\n",

    "Cruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise's film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on Erik Larson's New York Times bestseller, The Devil in the White City about a real-life serial killer, H. H. Holmes, at Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition. Kathryn Bigelow is attached to the project to produce and helm.

    "On August 22, 2006, Paramount Pictures announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In the Wall Street Journal, chairman of Viacom (Paramount's parent company) Sumner Redstone cited the economic damage to Cruise's value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views.[53][54] Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount's announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from private equity firms.[55]\n",
    "\n",
    "Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount's discontent over Cruise/Wagner's exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the Mission: Impossible franchise.[56][57]\n",
    "Management of United Artists\n",
    "\n",
    "In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists.[49] Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA's chief executive.\n",

    "Production began in 2007 of Valkyrie, a thriller based on the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007, Cruise signed to play Claus von Stauffenberg, the protagonist. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. Lambs was released on November 9, 2007,[58] opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.\n",

Rogers introduced Cruise to the Church of Scientology.[65] He met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film Days of Thunder (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. Cruise and Kidman adopted two children, Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995). In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. The pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. In 2007, Kidman clarified rumors of a miscarriage early in her marriage to Cruise, saying in an interview, \"It was wrongly reported,\" and explaining that she had actually had an ectopic pregnancy.[66] Before Kidman's next marriage to Keith Urban, she spoke of how much she still loved Cruise, saying in 2006: \"He was huge; still is. To me, he was just Tom, but to everybody else, he is huge. But he was lovely to me. And I loved him. I still love him.\"[67]\n",

    "\n",
    "An article in the October 2012 issue of Vanity Fair states that several sources have said that after the breakup with Cruz, the Church of Scientology launched a secret project to find Cruise a new girlfriend. According to those sources, a series of \"auditions\" of Scientologist actresses resulted in a short-lived relationship with British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi, who subsequently left Scientology.[69] The Church of Scientology and Cruise's lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing Vanity Fair of \"shoddy journalism\" and \"religious bigotry.\"[70] Journalist Roger Friedman later reported that he received an email from director and ex-Scientologist Paul Haggis confirming the story.[71][72]\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 2005, Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes. On April 27 that year, Cruise and Holmes – dubbed \"TomKat\" by the media – made their first public appearance together in Rome.[73] A month later, Cruise publicly declared his love for Holmes on The Oprah Winfrey Show, jumping up and down on Winfrey's couch during the show.[74] On October 6, 2005, Cruise and Holmes announced they were expecting a child.[75] In April 2006 their daughter Suri was born.\n",

    "On November 18, 2006, Holmes and Cruise were married at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy, in a Scientology ceremony attended by many Hollywood stars.[76][77] The actors' publicist said the couple had \"officialized\" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony.[78] There has been widespread speculation that their marriage was arranged by the Church of Scientology.[79][80] David Miscavige, the head of the Church of Scientology, served as Cruise's best man.[81]\n",
    "\n",
    "On June 29, 2012, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise after five and a half years of marriage.[82][83] On July 9, 2012, the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers.[84] Because New York law requires that all divorce documents remain sealed, the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available.[85]\n",

Ron Hubbard Study Tech, helped him overcome dyslexia.[88]\n",
    "Cruise's advocacy of Scientology\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to Scientology, Cruise has campaigned for Scientology to be recognized as a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Paris city council revealed that Cruise had lobbied officials Nicolas Sarkozy and Jean-Claude Gaudin, described him as a spokesman and militant for Scientology, and barred any further dealings with him.[89][90]\n",
    "\n",
    "Cruise co-founded and raised donations for Downtown Medical to offer New York City 9/11 rescue workers detoxification therapy based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. This drew criticism from the medical profession[91] and from firefighters.[92]\n",

    "For such activities, Scientology leader David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004.[93]\n",
    "Criticism of psychiatry\n",
    "\n",
    "In January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement \"I think psychiatry should be outlawed.\"[94] Further controversy erupted in 2005 after he openly criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an anti-depressant to which Shields attributes her recovery from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. Shields responded that Cruise \"should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them\".[95] This led to a heated argument between Matt Lauer and Cruise on NBC's Today on June 24, 2005.[96]\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical authorities view Cruise's comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness.[97][98] Shields herself called Cruise's comments \"a disservice to mothers everywhere.\"[99] In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.[100]\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and the psychoactive drugs which are routinely prescribed for treatment.[93] It was reported that Cruise's anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg.[101] Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise's presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor's office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.[102]\n",

    "\n",
    "After YouTube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the fair use clause. It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of April 2019, the video has achieved over 13 million views. YouTube has declined to remove it again, due to the popularity of the video, and subsequent changes to copyright policy of the Web site.[107]\n",

    "In March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise's next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, Cruise's sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005.[109] DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan.[110] Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on Scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes.[111][112]\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2015 documentary Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief cast a spotlight on Cruise's role in Scientology. The film alleges that Cruise used Sea Org workers as a source of free labor.[113] In the film, Cruise's former auditor Marty Rathbun claims that wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Tom Cruise's suggestion (which Cruise's lawyer denies).[114][115]\n",

In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a 'hot shot' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do.[124]\n",

    "\n",
    "In May 2001, he filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had told the celebrity magazine Actustar that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise,[126] and Slater was later ordered to pay $10 million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default. Cruise requested a default judgment and, in January 2003, a Los Angeles judge decided against Slater after the porn actor said that his story was false.[127][128]\n",
    "\n",
    "Cruise also sued Bold Magazine publisher Michael Davis for $100 million, because Davis had alleged (though never confirmed) that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.[129]\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com.

    "\n",
    "In 2009, Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise's behest. That suit was dismissed by a Central Civil West court judge in Los Angeles on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired on Sapir's claim.[131][132]\n",
